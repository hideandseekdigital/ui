# direnv + nvm

Automatically switch to the project's Node.js version when you `cd` into the repository. No manual `nvm use` required.

## How it works

Two files work together:

| File     | Purpose                                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `.nvmrc` | Declares the required Node.js major version (e.g. `20`)                  |
| `.envrc` | Loaded by direnv on `cd`; sources nvm and activates the declared version |

When you enter the project directory direnv runs `.envrc`, which installs the declared Node version (if missing) and activates it for your shell session. Leaving the directory restores the previous environment automatically.

## Installation

### macOS

**Homebrew** (recommended):

```bash
brew install direnv nvm
```

Homebrew installs nvm to a prefix path rather than `$HOME/.nvm`. The `.envrc` handles this automatically by falling back to `$(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh` when `$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh` is not found.

Add to the **end** of `~/.zshrc` (or `~/.bashrc` for bash):

```bash
# nvm
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

# direnv
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"   # replace zsh with bash if needed
```

**Manual nvm install** (alternative):

```bash
# Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.0/install.sh | bash

# Install direnv
brew install direnv
```

The install script appends the nvm bootstrap to your shell profile automatically.

Then add the direnv hook to the **end** of `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
```

Restart your shell (or `source ~/.zshrc`) after editing the profile.

---

### Linux

```bash
# Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.0/install.sh | bash
```

The script appends the following to your `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```

Install direnv using your package manager:

```bash
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install direnv

# Arch
sudo pacman -S direnv

# Fedora
sudo dnf install direnv

# Or via the official install script:
curl -sfL https://direnv.net/install.sh | bash
```

Add the direnv hook to the **end** of `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
eval "$(direnv hook bash)"   # replace bash with zsh if needed
```

Restart your shell after editing the profile.

---

### Windows

direnv and nvm are Unix tools. On Windows the recommended path is **WSL 2**. A Git Bash alternative is available for teams that cannot use WSL.

#### Option A — WSL 2 (recommended)

WSL 2 provides a full Linux environment. Follow the [Linux instructions](#linux) inside your WSL shell. Your editor (VS Code, JetBrains) should be configured to open projects inside WSL for the environment to be active.

Install WSL 2 if you haven't already:

```powershell
# Run in PowerShell (Administrator)
wsl --install
```

Then open a WSL terminal and follow the [Linux setup](#linux) above.

#### Option B — Git Bash + nvm-windows

If WSL is not available, direnv and [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) can be used together in Git Bash.

**1. Install nvm-windows**

Download and run the installer from the [nvm-windows releases page](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases). This installs `nvm.exe` and adds it to `PATH`.

nvm-windows exposes `nvm` as an executable in Git Bash — no `nvm.sh` sourcing is needed. The `.envrc` detects this automatically.

**2. Install direnv**

Download the latest Windows binary from the [direnv releases page](https://github.com/direnv/direnv/releases) (`direnv.windows-amd64.exe`), rename it to `direnv.exe`, and place it somewhere on your `PATH` (e.g. `C:\Program Files\direnv\`).

**3. Hook direnv into Git Bash**

Add to `~/.bashrc` inside Git Bash:

```bash
eval "$(direnv hook bash)"
```

Restart Git Bash after editing.

:::note
nvm-windows reads `.nvmrc` when a version is passed explicitly. The `.envrc` in this project uses `nvm install "$version"` and `nvm use "$version"` (reading from `.nvmrc`), which is compatible with both nvm and nvm-windows.

## After cloning

After cloning a project that ships `.envrc`, run once:

```bash
direnv allow
```

direnv prompts for this on every new `.envrc` it has not seen before — this is a security feature that prevents untrusted scripts from running automatically. Re-run `direnv allow` whenever `.envrc` changes.

---

## Files

### `.nvmrc`

Contains just the Node.js major version:

```
20
```

Update this when the project requires a new minimum Node version. The [Create CLI](/create-cli) sets it to the major version of the Node that ran the command.

### `.envrc`

```bash
export NVM_DIR="${NVM_DIR:-$HOME/.nvm}"

# Source the nvm shell function.
# Handles: manual install ($HOME/.nvm), Homebrew on macOS, and WSL.
# On Windows with nvm-windows, nvm is already an executable in PATH — no sourcing needed.
if [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ]; then
  . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
elif [ "$(uname -s 2>/dev/null)" = "Darwin" ] && command -v brew &>/dev/null; then
  _nvm_sh="$(brew --prefix nvm 2>/dev/null)/nvm.sh"
  [ -s "$_nvm_sh" ] && . "$_nvm_sh"
  unset _nvm_sh
fi

if [ -f ".nvmrc" ]; then
  _node_version="$(tr -d '[:space:]' < .nvmrc)"
  nvm install "$_node_version"
  nvm use "$_node_version"
  unset _node_version
fi

# Ensure the pnpm shim declared in package.json#packageManager is active via Corepack.
# `corepack enable` is idempotent — safe to run on every cd.
if command -v corepack &>/dev/null; then
  corepack enable pnpm
fi
```

The script handles four environments:

| Environment                      | How nvm is loaded                                               |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS — manual install           | `$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh` sourced directly                            |
| macOS — Homebrew                 | `$(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh` sourced as fallback               |
| Linux / WSL 2                    | `$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh` sourced directly                            |
| Windows — Git Bash + nvm-windows | `nvm` is already in `PATH` as an executable; no sourcing needed |

The version is read explicitly from `.nvmrc` (stripping whitespace) and passed to both `nvm install` and `nvm use`, making the script compatible with both nvm and nvm-windows.

`corepack enable pnpm` installs a global shim so that running `pnpm` always delegates to the exact version declared in `package.json#packageManager` (e.g. `pnpm@9.15.0`). It is idempotent — safe to run on every `cd`. Corepack ships with Node.js 16.9+ so no separate install is required. If `corepack` is not in `PATH`, the block is skipped safely.

:::caution Avoid `corepack use pnpm`
`corepack use pnpm` (without an explicit version) writes the **latest** pnpm release into `package.json#packageManager`, silently upgrading the project. Never use it in `.envrc`.
:::

## `.gitignore`

Add the direnv cache directory — it contains compiled environment snapshots and should never be committed:

```
.direnv/
```

The [Create CLI](/create-cli) adds this automatically when the `direnv` feature is selected.

---

## Troubleshooting

**`direnv: command not found`** — direnv is not installed or not on `PATH`. Follow the installation steps for your platform above.

**`nvm: command not found` inside `.envrc`** — The `.envrc` could not locate `nvm.sh`. Check:

- Manual install: confirm `$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh` exists.
- Homebrew (macOS): confirm `brew list nvm` shows nvm is installed.
- The `NVM_DIR` environment variable is not pointing somewhere unexpected.

**`direnv` not activating on `cd`** — The shell hook is missing or in the wrong position. Make sure `eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"` (or bash) appears at the very **end** of your shell profile, after all other tool initialisations.

**`nvm use` reports wrong version on Windows** — Ensure nvm-windows v1.1.10 or later is installed. Earlier versions do not reliably accept explicit version arguments.
