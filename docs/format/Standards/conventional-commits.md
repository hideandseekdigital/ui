# Conventional Commits

All Hide & Seek repositories follow the [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for commit messages. This gives us machine-readable history, automatic changelogs, and a shared vocabulary for what a commit does.

## Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

The first line (header) must not exceed **72 characters**. Everything else is optional.

## Quick examples

```
feat(auth): add magic-link login flow
fix(api): handle null response from payment provider
docs: clarify AGENTS.md authoring guide
refactor(ui): extract Button into shared component library
chore(deps): bump eslint-config to v0.2.0
feat!: drop support for Node 18
```

## Type reference

| Type       | When to use                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `feat`     | A new feature visible to users or API consumers  |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                        |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes only                       |
| `style`    | Formatting or whitespace — no logic change       |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring with no feature or bug change |
| `perf`     | A performance improvement                        |
| `test`     | Adding or correcting tests                       |
| `build`    | Build system or dependency changes               |
| `ci`       | CI/CD pipeline changes                           |
| `chore`    | Maintenance that doesn't fit elsewhere           |
| `revert`   | Reverts a previous commit                        |

## Scope

The scope is optional and goes in parentheses after the type. It names the part of the codebase the commit touches:

```
feat(auth): ...
fix(checkout): ...
refactor(ui/button): ...
```

Use lowercase, kebab-case names. If a commit spans many areas, omit the scope rather than writing a vague one.

## Description

- Imperative, present tense: **"add"** not "added" or "adds"
- No capital letter at the start
- No period at the end
- Describes _what_ the commit does, not _how_

```
✓  feat: add dark mode toggle
✗  feat: Added dark mode toggle.
✗  feat: dark mode
```

## Body

The body explains the _why_ behind a change — context that won't be obvious from the diff. Wrap at 72 characters.

```
fix(api): retry on transient 503 from payments provider

The payments API returns a 503 during brief maintenance windows.
Previously this caused checkout to fail immediately. Now we retry
up to 3 times with exponential back-off before surfacing an error.
```

## Breaking changes

Signal a breaking change in one of two ways:

**Inline `!` after the type** (for the header only):

```
feat!: remove deprecated /v1/users endpoint
```

**`BREAKING CHANGE:` footer** (required when a body explains the break):

```
feat(api)!: require explicit content-type header on all requests

BREAKING CHANGE: requests without a Content-Type header now return
400. Previously the API defaulted to application/json.
```

A breaking change bumps the **major** version in SemVer (`1.0.0` → `2.0.0`).

## Versioning implications

When using [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) or a changelog tool that understands Conventional Commits:

| Commit type                           | SemVer bump               |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `fix`, `perf`                         | patch (`1.0.0` → `1.0.1`) |
| `feat`                                | minor (`1.0.0` → `1.1.0`) |
| Any with `!` or `BREAKING CHANGE`     | major (`1.0.0` → `2.0.0`) |
| All others (`docs`, `chore`, `ci`, …) | none                      |

## Multi-commit PRs

Each commit in a PR should be independently meaningful and deployable. Prefer:

```
feat(auth): scaffold magic-link token model
feat(auth): add magic-link send endpoint
feat(auth): add magic-link verify endpoint
test(auth): add integration tests for magic-link flow
docs(auth): document magic-link API in AGENTS.md
```

Over a single `feat(auth): implement magic-link` that touches everything at once. Granular commits make `git bisect` and revert effective.

## The `/commit` skill

The `/commit` agent skill (documented in [AGENTS.md specs](/Standards/agent-specs)) automates this workflow:

1. Inspects the staged diff
2. Infers the correct type, scope, and description
3. Proposes a commit message for your review
4. Commits only after you confirm

```
/commit
/commit auth module
```

The skill will never push or amend — it only creates a new local commit.

## Linting commit messages

To enforce Conventional Commits in CI, add [commitlint](https://commitlint.io):

```bash
pnpm add -D @commitlint/cli @commitlint/config-conventional
```

`commitlint.config.js`:

```js
export default {
  extends: ["@commitlint/config-conventional"],
};
```

GitHub Actions hook:

```yaml
- name: Lint commit messages
  uses: wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v6
```
